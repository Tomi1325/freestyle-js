Game rules:

- The game has 2 players and is divided into rounds
- Each round, the player rolls the dice as many times as (s)he wishes. The result of the rolls is added to the player's scores for that round, which starts from zero in each round.
- If the current player rolls a number 1, all his/her points are lost and he passes the right to roll to the next player.
- The player can also select the 'I hold it' button. In this case, the number of points scored in that round will be added to the player's total points. The right to roll is then transferred to the other player.
- The player who reaches 100 points first wins.
